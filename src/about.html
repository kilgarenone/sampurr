      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>
        For the most parts, I aimed to replicate the gestures you are familiar
        with when sampling in DAW.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To zoom in or out the waveform &mdash; Mousewheel</li>
        <li>
          To navigate the waveform &mdash; Click, hold and drag horizontally
        </li>
        <li>
          To create a sample &mdash; Double-click and drag on the waveform
        </li>
        <li>To Pause/Play &mdash; Hit <kbd>Space</kbd></li>
        <li>
          To seek in the track &mdash; Press and hold the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key
          and click where you want to go
        </li>
      </ul>

            <p>
              The audio track
              <strong>can not be more than 10 minutes long</strong> due to
              performance concern when rendering the waveform on browser(hence
              user experience). I will explore this more, but so far it feels
              laggy with anything past 10min on my 2yo Windows laptop.

              You might run into the geo-blocking issue. My server is located in
              US, so I suppose anything that isn't blocked over there. In the
              case of Youtube, you could try other videos with the same track.
              Beyond that, honestly, I don't know yet how to circumvent this for
              everyone from anywhere on everything.

      This service requires a server to run. And that costs money. Some
      treefiddy thrown my way would be much appreciated!
